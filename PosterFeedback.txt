Your poster looks nice.  However, you need to have your pictures
   on the poster someplace.  One thing you can do is to move the
   bullets a bit closer together vertically in your text boxes.
   This will give you a bit more room at the bottom of one side
   or the other for your team's pictures.  You can match that on
   the other side by adding the logos of the technologies you are
   using.

I'm not sure about the background color.  It would be a good idea
   to check with Masao to see what he thinks.  If he is OK with
   it, I'm fine too ~ I like the color, it's just a matter of if
   Masao thinks it will use too much ink from the printer.

Once you have made those changes, e-mail a copy to Masao for printing.
