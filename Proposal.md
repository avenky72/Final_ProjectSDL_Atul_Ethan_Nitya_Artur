Our project is a fashion curation and viewing app. 
It combines the inspiration and mood board aspect of Pinterest but has the direct brand links for the products so that users can find the piece itself.
Users can save outfits containing clothing items found on their page based on theme/aesthetic, then for further organization they can save their outfits into "closets". Users can have multiple closets depending on how they want to organize them, allowing other users to see their taste expression through different folders of outfits. 
Furthermore, the ability of our app to hold the original source for each product allows users to connect directly with the brands and retailers of the clothing articles. Even if it is not the direct user's outfit or closet, if they find a product they are interested in from another persons' profile (their closet or an outfit), they can still find a source to view/buy the product. 

This project will apply skills and tools we’ve learned from other classes for the front-end (Next.js/Tailwind), backend (Node.js), database/cloud storage (AWS S3), and AI/ML (for outfit recommendations/similar outfits)
It’s an appropriate difficulty because we have to combine stuff we already know (frontend/backend/UX design) with newer topics (AI/ML/Data). 
This allows us to build a fullstack project from scratch with realtime collaboration features (sharing boards) and AI features (output recommendations). 
The project has some clear challenges we will have to work on (image uploads, drag and drop functionality, database design, linking articles to retailers, AI recommendation system and UX design.
While everyone could work on everything, we could also split up tasks as frontend, backend, database, AI, UX design, etc based on what we’re doing.
