Homework Assignment #1
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
======================

SUMMARY:
The essay accurately captures the main points of the APA article
"Psychological Testing and Assessments Are Going High Tech."  It
highlights the shift from traditional neuropsychological tests to
VR-based assessments and emphasizes the benefits such as realism,
cost-effectiveness, and improved engagement, especially among
younger users.

The essay includes key ideas such as the use of VR for ADHD
assessment, the limitations of traditional testing, the role of games
in cognitive evaluation, and the importance of sustained/selective
attention, working memory, and task switching.


The essay references Albert Rizzo and Gazzaley, incorporating quotes
and paraphrased content effectively.


The summary is generally clear and logically structured, though some
sentences could benefit from improved grammar and punctuation for better
readability.

The writer goes beyond summarizing by reflecting on the implications of the
article, such as the generational divide in tech adoption and the potential
for VR to revolutionize assessments.

CRITICAL THINKING:
The essay makes a strong connection between the article’s content and the
team's own software project ~ a fashion app.  It explores how VR assessments
could enhance user experience and data collection.

The proposed ideas ~ such as virtual closets, real-time fitting rooms, and
machine learning-based personalization ~ are creative and demonstrate forward-
thinking.

While the ideas are innovative, the essay could benefit from a more critical
look at the technical feasibility, resource requirements, and potential
limitations of implementing VR and ML in their app.

The essay could more explicitly tie the discussion back to core software
engineering principles such as user-centered design, system requirements, or
prototyping.

The section is rich in ideas but could be better organized.  Some paragraphs
are long and could be broken up for clarity.  Transitions between ideas could
be smoother.
