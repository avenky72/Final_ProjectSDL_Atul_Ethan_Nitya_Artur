Our project is a fashion-related app. 
It combines the inspiration and mood board aspect of Pinterest with the brand links so that users can find the exact pieces. 
Users can upload outfits based on theme/aesthetic in their closet and can have multiple closets. 
This allows users to connect directly with the brands and retailers of the clothing articles. 

This project will apply skills and tools we’ve learned from other classes for the front-end (Next.js/Tailwind), backend (Node.js), database/cloud storage, and AI/ML (for outfit recommendations/similar outfits)
It’s an appropriate difficulty because we have to combine stuff we already know (frontend/backend/UX design) with newer topics (AI/ML/Data). 
This allows us to build a fullstack project from scratch with realtime collaboration features (sharing boards) and AI features (output recommendations). 
The project has some clear challenges we will have to work on (image uploads, drag and drop functionality, database design, linking articles to retailers, AI recommendation system and UX design.
While everyone could work on everything, we could also split up tasks as frontend, backend, database, AI, UX design, etc based on what we’re doing.
