ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Strengths:
      Clear separation of Frontend, Backend, and Database components.
      Each major component is named and described with its responsibilities
         (e.g., Authentication Module, Product Service).
      Technology stack is explicitly stated (Next.js, Node.js, Supabase,
         PostgreSQL), which aids clarity.
   Suggestions:
      Include rationale for architectural choices (e.g., why Supabase vs.
         traditional ORM, why Next.js for SSR).
      Add non-functional requirements mapping (e.g., scalability, security,
         performance) to show how architecture supports them.
      Consider specifying deployment architecture (e.g., cloud provider,
         containerization, CI/CD pipeline) for completeness.

   Major softwre components section
      Strengths:
         Components are grouped logically by layer
            (Frontend, Backend, Database).
         Each component lists its main functions (CRUD, authentication, etc.)
         Database schema tables are identified with indexes for performance.
      Suggestions:
         Add interfaces between components (e.g., what data structures or
            DTOs are exchanged between Frontend and Backend).
         Include responsibility boundaries (e.g., which component handles
            validation vs. business logic).
         Consider adding error handling strategies for each major component.

   Major software interactions section
      Strengths:
         Interaction flows are described
            (login, product fetch, closet creation).
         Communication protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, REST, JWT) are specified.
         External integrations (Google OAuth, Cloudinary, web scrapers)
            are noted.
      Suggestions:
         Include sequence diagrams or interaction diagrams for at least one
            critical use case (login flow is mentioned later but could be
               referenced here).
         Add data flow security considerations (e.g., encryption in transit,
            token expiration).
         Specify real-time features decision (WebSocket is mentioned as "maybe"
            clarify if included or deferred).

   Architectural design diagrams section
      Strengths:
         High-level diagram showing Frontend -> Backend -> Database is present
         External services are listed (OAuth, image hosting, scrapers).
      Suggestions:
         Diagram could be more detailed: include arrows for data flow, label
            protocols (HTTPS, Supabase client).
         Add component-level diagrams for internal Backend architecture
            (controllers, services).
         Consider including deployment diagram (e.g., how services run in
            containers, load balancer, CDN).

Overall Completeness Assessment
   Strengths: The document is strong in listing components, technologies,
      and basic interactions. It provides a solid foundation for
      implementation.
   Gaps: Missing rationale for design decisions, non-functional
      requirement mapping, detailed interaction diagrams, and
      deployment considerations.
