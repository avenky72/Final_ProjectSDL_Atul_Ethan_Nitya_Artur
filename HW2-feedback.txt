problem 1, Correct and clear, though grammar and spelling need improvement.

problem 2, Needs correction — Agile phases are requirements, design,
   implementation, testing, and review.  While initial planning helps,
   repeating phases ensures adaptability and prevents costly rework.

problem 3, Needs improvement — Waterfall phases are requirements, design,
   implementation, verification, maintenance.  Waterfall phases occur
   sequentially and include detailed documentation and risk analysis.  These
   are essential for compliance in large or regulated projects.  Agile may
   adopt similar rigor for safety-critical systems.

problem 4, Good overall, though phrasing could be clearer.

problem 6, Incorrect for second blank (User Story instead of Estimate) and
   last blank (Blueskying instead of Planning Poker).

problem 7, Needs correction — It’s an overly optimistic estimate assuming
   no problems and even extra efficiencies.  Always plan for realistic
   conditions and potential setbacks.

Your answers show understanding of core concepts but need improvement in
   accuracy and clarity for Agile and Waterfall phases, Problem 6, and
   Problem 7.  Grammar and spelling should also be refined for
   professionalism.  Strengths include practical examples and thoughtful
   opinions.  Overall, this submission meets basic requirements but requires
   corrections for full accuracy.

nice work!
