==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      CSC groupings are clearly defined: Frontend, Backend,
         and Data Management.
      CSU descriptions include purpose, location, fields, and methods
         for key classes (e.g., AuthProvider, SupabaseAuthController).
      Backend services and endpoints are documented with HTTP methods
         and parameters.
   Suggestions:
      Include design rationale for grouping CSCs and CSUs (why certain
         services are separated or combined).
      Add error handling strategies and edge cases for each CSU.
      Provide dependencies and constraints (e.g., which CSUs rely on
         external APIs or libraries).
      Consider adding state diagrams or lifecycle descriptions for complex
         CSUs (e.g., authentication flow).


DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Each class lists fields, methods, and responsibilities.
      Locations in the codebase are specified, which aids traceability.
      Security considerations (bcrypt, JWT) are mentioned for authentication
         classes.
   Suggestions:
      Add method signatures with parameter types and return types
         for clarity.
      Include preconditions and postconditions for critical methods
         (e.g., login, register).
      Document error codes or exceptions thrown by methods.
      Consider adding performance considerations (e.g., pagination limits,
         caching strategies).


DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Not done.


DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      TypeScript interfaces for core entities (Product, User, Closet, etc.)
         are provided.
      Includes API response structure and JWT payload format.
      JSON example for web scraper output is clear and realistic.
   Suggestions:
      Add validation rules for each field (e.g., max length, allowed values).
      Include relationships between data structures (e.g., how Closet
         references Product).
      Document default values and optional fields explicitly.
      Consider adding serialization/deserialization details for API responses.


DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths:
      Multiple diagrams provided: sequence, activity, ERD, component class,
         and state diagrams.
      ERD is detailed and shows cardinality.
      State diagram for user session is helpful for understanding lifecycle.
   Suggestions:
      Ensure UML notation consistency across diagrams.
      Add interaction diagrams for critical workflows (e.g., outfit creation,
         product search).
      Include deployment diagram to show runtime environment and connections.
      Consider adding data flow diagrams for external integrations
         (e.g., Google OAuth, Cloudinary).


DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   Not done.

Overall Completeness Assessment
   Strengths: The document is strong in class-level detail, data structures,
      and diagrams. It provides a solid foundation for implementation and
      traceability.
   Gaps: Missing rationale for design decisions, validation rules, error
      handling details, and deployment considerations. Some diagrams could
      be expanded for completeness.

Make some of the suggested additions/changes to the document by the end of
   the semester for full credit on both sections.
